                           README for orc.zip


Welcome! This archive includes the compiler and runtime engine for the
Orc language, along with the standard Orc library.

Orc runs in a Java SE 6 runtime environment.  Required JARs are
included here, in the "lib" directory.

There are numerous examples of Orc programs included in the "examples"
directory.

Orc can be used in several different ways:
- Eclipse IDE plug-in
- Command line JVM invocation
- Mac OS X application
- Embedded in other applications
- Web interface
- SOAP/JSON/RMI

The command line and embedded usage methods only require this archive
(orc.zip). See the file INSTALL for details. There remaining ways to
use Orc, require separate archives, available at the Orc Web site.

See http://orc.csres.utexas.edu/ for more information about Orc,
including the language user's guide, discussion groups, a wiki, and more.

See the files LICENSE and licenses.yml for license agreements.
