{- gOrc.orc
 - 
 - gOrc - a bunch of Orc gibberish
 - 
 - gOrc creates a number of tokens equal to totalTokens that
 - are valid Orc tokens and puts them together with a space
 - as the token separator.  This simulates gibberish
 - input to the parser.  The tokens are randomized from a Map().
 - You can modify it to make it an actual program if a sequence pops up that
 - looks like it would make a good test case.  Another good way to 
 - use it is to put the totalTokens at a really high number, then
 - examine the output to see if any interesting sequences appear.
 - 
 - This is not meant to automatically produce programs,
 - only to generate new ideas for parser test cases.
