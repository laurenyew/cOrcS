                          INSTALL for orc.zip


OVERVIEW
--------

Orc runs in a Java SE 6 runtime environment.  Required JARs are
included here, in the "lib" directory.

Read one of the following sections depending on your environment.


COMMAND LINE USERS
------------------

You can run Orc programs directly from any OS's command prompt.

To run <your script file>:
  java -cp orc-2.0.2.jar:lib/\* orc.Main <your script file>

To see command-line arguments, run:
  java -cp orc-2.0.2.jar:lib/\* orc.Main -?

Suggested .profile entry, assuming Orc is in your ${HOME}/orc directory:
  alias orc='java -cp ${HOME}/orc/orc-2.0.2.jar:${HOME}/orc/lib/\* orc.Main'

Windows command line users, change the classpath options above to:
  -cp orc-2.0.2.jar;lib\*


WINDOWS USERS
-------------

To associate .orc files with the Orc JAR, run SETUP.BAT from the directory
where you put orc-2.0.2.jar.  If you move the orc-2.0.2.jar, you will need to
rerun SETUP.BAT.  If desired, you can edit the association in Explorer's "File
Types" dialog to add command-line arguments or change the icon.


ORC SITE DEVELOPERS
-------------------

The JAR can be used as a Java library with which you can develop your own
Orc sites.  Simply place orc-2.0.2.jar and its dependencies on your project's
classpath.

Refer to the Javadoc at http://orc.csres.utexas.edu/javadoc/STABLE for
more information on Orc's Java API.
